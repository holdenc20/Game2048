# Game2048
 
2048 is a popular tile game which can be found: https://play2048.co/

The goal of the game is to achieve the highest tile posible by merging tiles by sliding the board: up, down, left, or right. After each move, a new tile(either a 2(90%) or a 4(10%)) is randomly added to the board.

The purpose of this project is to build a solver for the game that uses the minimax algorithm to 
determine the optimal move at a given situation. By doing this we can have the program play the 
game from the start and see how well it does. 

Enjoy!
